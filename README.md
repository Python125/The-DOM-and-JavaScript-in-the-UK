# The-DOM-&-JavaScript-in-the-UK

Here's a neat project giving me a chance to continue to flex my programming muscles using HTML, CSS, and JS, while getting some experience with the DOM. It allowed me to experiment with various dynamic web elements, creating interactive visual effects that enhance the user experience. Inspired by my travels to Great Britain,  I incorporated multiple text containers with images focused on attractions, food, travel tips, and English culture.

This project marked my initial foray into DOM manipulation. I was fascinated by the ability to dynamically alter a webpage's elements. Experimenting with techniques like creating a shrinking hero image and animated text containers significantly enhanced my understanding of JavaScript's power to transform static HTML into interactive experiences.
