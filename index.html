            the southern part of the island of Great Britain, and is bordered by

          <h3>Humour</h3>
          <p>
            English humour is often characterized as being dry, witty, and
            self-deprecating. It is an important aspect of social interaction,
            and can be seen in a wide range of contexts, from television shows
            and movies to everyday conversations. Some examples of English
            humour include Monty Python, Blackadder, and the works of writers
            such as P.G. Wodehouse and Douglas Adams. The ability to use humour
            in social situations is often seen as a sign of intelligence and
            social skill in English culture.
